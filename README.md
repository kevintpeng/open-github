# Open Github
open-github introduces two commands to seamlessly transition between your command line and your browser for most git workflows. This gem installs command executables to your system.

### Installation
*Note: Only works on Mac, due to the nature of the `open` command and lack of GUI on some distros.*

To install the commands: `gem install open-github`
